# Abstract2Title T5 Model Fine-tuning

![Colab Banner](colab_banner.png)

This repository is dedicated to fine-tuning the T5 model for the specific task of generating titles for given abstracts. It's a powerful tool for automatic summarization and content generation.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

This repository consists of the following components:

- **Google Colab Notebook:** An interactive Colab notebook that guides you through the fine-tuning process. It's designed to make the process as smooth as possible.

- **Dataset:** The dataset used for fine-tuning, provided in both training and testing sets in CSV format. This dataset forms the basis for training and evaluation.

- **Python file:** This repo also contains the Python file of the Notebook to run this on local machine with virtual environment. If you want to run this on local machine then you have to install some dependencies in your virtual environment.
