# Abstract2Title T5 Model Fine-tuning

This repository is to fine-tune the T5 model for the specific task of generating titles for given abstracts. It's a powerful tool for automatic summarization and content generation.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

This repository consists of the following components:

- **Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive Jupyter notebook that guides you through the fine-tuning process. It's designed to make the process as smooth as possible.

- **Dataset:** The dataset used for fine-tuning, is provided in both training and testing sets in CSV format. This dataset forms the basis for training and evaluation.

- **Python File:** This repo also contains the Python file of the Notebook to run this on the local machine with the virtual environment. If you want to run this on a local machine then you have to install some dependencies in your virtual environment. The dependencies are down below:

- **Train on Local Machine:** To train and test this model on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Voice-Detection.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
  ```sh
  cd T5-Abstract2Title-master
  ```
3. **Install requirements:**
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To fine-tune the T5 model using this repository and the provided dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Google Colab Notebook:** Click the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tHGnpP2n83f0od_aOfoGoQsjGxXLxQfY">Open in Colab</a> button and this will open this notebook in colab.

2. **Or clone this repo:** If this does not work then simply clone this repo in google colab.

3. **Run the Notebook:** Follow the instructions provided within the Colab notebook. It will guide you through the steps of fine-tuning the T5 model.

Happy fine-tuning and text generation!
